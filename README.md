# 15112-project-arabesque
Highly symmetric design software

Designed by: Mohammed Nurul Hoque

To start the program run the Main.py file

Requirements:
- python 2.7
- Tkinter
- PIL
- Microsoft windows (I am not sure, but win32clipboard module is used)

Know issues:
- when the program is closed, sometimes the program shows an error message.
  It is apparenty a bug in PIL, because the error is not a python error, but
  a visual c++ error.
