# 15112-project-arabesque
My First semester programming project in Python. It is a program for drawing symmetric patterns with support for layers.
Some features:
- BÃ©zier curves
- Linear and radial patterns
- Layers
- Bucket fill

To start the program run the Main.py file

Requirements:
- python 2.7
- Tkinter
- PIL
- Microsoft windows (win32clipboard module is used)

Know issues:
- when the program is closed, sometimes the program shows an error message.
  It is apparenty a bug in PIL, because the error is not a python error, but
  a visual c++ error.
